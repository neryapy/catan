the catan game open-source, on the lan(for multiplayer) and with friendly gui. to run you just need to use the party manager to play! this a fun project devloped by me as passion. 
if you want to play out your lan you can use a vpn style hamachi or zerotier. or you can port forward to the port of your party.
you can run the compilled version in relese, because the project are on java this work on any system, any cpu architecture.
