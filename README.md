the catan game open-source, on the lan(for multiplayer) and with friendly gui. to run you just need to use the party manager to play! this a fun project devloped by me, as passion. if you want to play outdoor from  your lan you can use a vpn style hamachi or zerotier. or you can port forward to the port of your party. you can run the compiled version in release, because the project was developed on java, the version run on any system, any cpu architecture.
